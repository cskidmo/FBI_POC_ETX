      ## Cargo Theft

      Cargo theft includes-but is not limited to-theft of goods, chattel, money, or baggage that constitutes, in whole or in part, a commercial freight shipment moving in commerce.

      Image of cargo being loaded into the cargo hold of an airplane.

      Theft can occur from, but not limited to, the following:

      Methods of transportation: pipeline system, railroad car, motor truck, tank, vessel, aircraft, other vehicle
      Locations: storage facility, station house, platform, depot, wharf, airport, air navigation facility, container freight station, warehouse, freight distribution facility, freight consolidation facility
      Containers: intermodal container, intermodal chassis, trailer

      ## Types of cargo theft

      Straight cargo theft occurs when cargo is physically stolen from its current location. Cargo thieves often look for items they can steal and sell quickly.

      This often occurs at truck stops, parking lots, roadside parking, drop lots, rail yards and other situations where cargo is left unattended.

      Strategic cargo theft occurs when thieves incorporate deceptive tactics to commit theft. This type of cargo theft involves the use of fraud to trick shippers, brokers, and carriers into handing loads over to thieves instead of the legitimate carrier. Other current strategic cargo theft trends include identity theft, fictitious pick-ups, account takeovers, double brokering scams, and fraudulent carriers as well as the implementation of a combination of these methods.

      Cyber cargo theft occurs when basic types of cyberattacks are used to aid in committing cargo theft. The attacks include phishing emails that install Trojan Horse malware granting access to a company's systems for thieves to retrieve sensitive data. Thieves then use this information to print out copies of legitimate shipping paperwork they can use to commit fictitious pick-ups.

      Pilferage cargo theft occurs when criminals alter the bill of lading and pilfer small amounts off the truck.

    questions_and_answers:

      - question: | 
          What information is collected?
        
        answer: | 
          Information collected includes what type of property is stolen, whether the cargo was taken by force, whether the theft involves fraud, the location of the theft, the type of weapon used if any, the value of the property stolen, and the description of the property stolen. In addition, information on the recovery of the stolen property and any information about the victim and the offender are collected as well.

      - question: |
          How is the data used?
        answer: | 
          Information collected about the stolen property, the circumstance of the theft, whether force was used for not and the offender provides the agency insight into potential national security threats.


  - context: |
      The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program collects cargo theft data to inform the law enforcement community, federal and state legislators, academia, and the public at large about this particular crime. The data can be used to create awareness and to measure the impact cargo theft has on the economy and potential threats to national security. Often cargo theft offenses are part of larger criminal schemes and have been found to be components of organized crime rings, drug trafficking, and funding for terrorism. The UCR collection of cargo theft data is quite new with only 3 years of data published, but the number of agencies reporting cargo theft incidents has increased each year. As more agencies participate, future versions of this cargo theft report will depict a more complete account of the occurrences of cargo thefts in the United States.

      Background
      Due to the significant economic impact that cargo theft has on the United States economy, and the potential for use by terrorist organizations, H.R. 3199, the 'USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005,' was mandated by Congress on March 9, 2006. It required the Attorney General to 'take the steps necessary to ensure that reports of cargo theft collected by Federal, State, and local officials are reflected as a separate category in the Uniform Crime Reporting System, or any successor system, by no later than December 31, 2006.' In response to this mandate, the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Advisory Policy Board approved a definition for collecting Cargo Theft in December 2006. Creation of the data specifications required to capture cargo theft data in the UCR's Summary Reporting System as well as the National Incident-Based Reporting System were finalized in 2010 with the first publication of cargo theft data in 2013.

      What is cargo Theft?
      Cargo theft is defined as 'The criminal taking of any cargo including, but not limited to, goods, chattels, money, or baggage that constitutes, in whole or in part, a commercial shipment of freight moving in commerce, from any pipeline system, railroad car, motor truck, or other vehicle, or from any tank or storage facility, station house, platform, or depot, or from any vessel or wharf, or from any aircraft, air terminal, airport, aircraft terminal or air navigation facility, or from any intermodal container, intermodal chassis, trailer, container freight station, warehouse, freight distribution facility, or freight consolidation facility. For purposes of this definition, cargo shall be deemed as moving in commerce at all points between the point of origin and the final destination, regardless of any temporary stop while awaiting transshipment or otherwise.'
